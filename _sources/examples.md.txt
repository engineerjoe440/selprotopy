SELProtoPy may be used for a variety of standard interactions with SEL relays. The following
references are a variety of example use-cases or implementations of the SELProtoPy package.
Do not mistake them as recommendations, they are provided here as a support for education

```{note}
It's important to acknowledge that although SEL Protocol is largely standardized, this library
has only been used on, or tested against a limited set of SEL intelligent electronic devices.
As such you may encounter errors where such devices do not behave in an expected fashion.

In such cases, it is requested that an issue is opened on
[GitHub](https://github.com/engineerjoe440/selprotopy/issues) to make maintainers aware of the
problem.
